# Portfolio-Site
This site is intended to serve as a personal portfolio.  The site is not yet finished, but is published nonetheless to provide an early window into many aspects of my life.  It is certainly rough around the edges, though that will change over time.  I hope that you enjoy observing the evolution of this site as much as I'll enjoy working on it!
