                <i>Childhood and Upbringing in Shadowfell</i>
            </h6>
            <br>
            <p>
                Aman Mistaren was born into poverty on Briarborne Isle, one of the five islets that make up the
                Shattered Isles. The Shattered Isles are just off the mainland city of Gloomwrought, the largest city in
                all of Shadowfell. Aman was the oldest of three siblings, born to parents who struggled to make ends
                meet. Rennin was his younger brother, with the youngest of the three siblings being his sister Verra.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Aman's parents were both laborers who worked long hours to support the family. His father worked
                long hours on the docks of Gloomwrought, while his mother took odd jobs wherever she could. Despite
                their hardships, they were loving parents who did their best to shield their children from the dangers
                and corruption of the city. They instilled in their children the values of hard work, perseverance, and
                compassion, and always stressed the importance of family.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Aman spent his early years playing in the streets with other children from the neighborhood and
                exploring the islet's rocky beaches. One of his friends was a boy named Bob. Aman and Bob connected
                from the moment that they were first introduced, quickly becoming best friends. Bob was an outcast,
                though, mostly because he had a weird name. When other children would make fun of Bob for his
                weird name, though, Aman would come to his defense. The two of them would become lifelong friends,
                sharing a sense of adventure and mischief that would lead them on all sorts of unexpected adventures.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Aman had a close relationship with his grandparents who lived in a small cottage nearby, on the
                outskirts of the city. His grandfather was a retired factory worker, with his grandmother being a
                retired chef. He would frequently eat the delicious food that she cooked, particularly when there wasn't
                enough food at home. He often visited them to listen to their stories of the olden days. Frequently, his
                grandfather would tell stories of magical sorcerers and dragons that just seemed to be too fantastical
                to even possibly be real, but Aman always held a special appreciation for this time spent with his
                grandfather.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                One day while he was roaming the streets with Bob, they encountered a boy their age who was bullying
                a group of younger children. Without a thought, Bob cast invisibility on himself, disappearing from
                sight entirely. A bucket that was sitting on the ground suddenly began to float, eventually landing
                upside down on the bully's head. Shortly after, the bully found himself flat on his back with a trash
                can emptied on top of him. The younger children all scattered, giggling as they did. Aman felt something
                grab his arm and tug him in the direction of a nearby alleyway. Once hidden, Bob reappeared in front of
                him. Both boys were grinning from ear to ear, quite pleased with the events that just took place. Aman
                asked Bob where he learned that, to which Bob replied that his parents taught him.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Upon hearing that, Aman felt a bit deflated. His parents had repeatedly forbidden him from ever
                pursuing any knowledge of magic. They said that it would only lead to him ruining his life. This was
                their stance, though Aman suspected that they knew and used magic themselves. He saw little things
                happen that couldn't otherwise be explained. Broken things that were suddenly mended, injuries that
                were immediately healed, and once even a hand that seemed to float in the air while assisting them
                with chores. Aman did not know what was really happening with his parents or why they so strictly
                forbade him from learning about magic, but one thing was certain - he knew he wanted to learn about
                it.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Aman asked Bob to teach him, but Bob replied that it wasn't possible for just anyone to learn magic. He
                said that he was born with the ability and so were his parents. Aman insisted, so Bob caved and taught
                him how to cast the invisibility spell that he had just used. Aman repeated what Bob had taught him,
                suddenly disappearing from sight. Bob gasped, shocked at what just happened. The boys had just
                discovered that Aman was also able to learn magic.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Over time, Bob would continue learning from his parents. As he did, he would teach Aman what he
                learned while also letting Aman borrow old tomes to further his studies. Aman often experimented with
                casting spells in secret. His siblings would sometimes catch him muttering strange incantations under
                his breath, but he always managed to convince them that he was just reciting a poem or practicing a
                monologue for a play.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                As Aman grew older, he began to open up about his studies to his grandfather. He trusted his
                grandfather, frequently going to him for advice on topics that he would never open up to his parents
                about. From the moment the topic came up, his grandfather perked up and was clearly excited that
                Aman had discovered his abilities.
            </p>
            <br>


            <p>
                Aman's grandfather revealed that he, too, had such abilities. In fact, his mother did, as well. These
                abilities had been genetically passed down generation after generation, with Aman having inherited
                these abilities from an ancient bloodline of shadow sorcerers.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                He then explained that Aman's mother - without explanation - refused to teach Aman about these
                inherited abilities. He still doesn't know why, but has respected her wishes. Despite her wishes, Aman
                could not resist the pull of his innate magical abilities and would continue to secretly practice his
                magic in the shadows. His grandfather assisted him, while Bob continued teaching what he knew, as well.
                Over time, Aman would hone his skills as a shadow sorcerer. He would become quite powerful, having
                mastered numerous skills beyond what would have been expected of him at his age.
            </p>

                <i>Pursuit of Change in Shadowfell</i>
            </h6>
            <br>
            <p>
                As Aman grew older, he became increasingly aware of the stark socioeconomic inequality and
                corruption that plagued Shadowfell, and he began to question the ruling class that held power over the
                common people. The rich grew richer while the poor struggled to make ends meet, often resorting to
                desperate measures to survive. Aman could not bear to see his neighbors, friends, and family suffer
                under this oppressive rule, and was determined to do something about the problem.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Aman began to devise various plans to undermine the ruling class and level the playing field for
                everyone. He worked tirelessly to gather like-minded individuals who shared his vision of a fair and
                just society. Together, they plotted and schemed, but their efforts were repeatedly met with failure.
                Their
                attempts to undermine the ruling class were met with resistance at every turn. Equipment that was
                stolen was quickly replaced. Misinformation was promptly corrected. Any attempts to infiltrate their
                inner circle were blocked. Every act that Aman and his friends attempted to carry out was entirely
                ineffective. The ruling class had vast resources at their disposal and would stop at nothing to maintain
                their power and wealth. Aman and his allies were often outmatched and outmaneuvered, and they
                suffered numerous setbacks along the way. Despite the many setbacks, Aman formed close bonds with
                several of people that he made these efforts with. He found solace and companionship in their
                company, making it easier to deal with the repeated failures.

            <p>
                In an effort to gain an edge on his enemies, Aman continued to hone his skills as a shadow sorcerer,
                becoming more powerful with each passing day. He studied ancient tomes and sought out wise mentors
                who could guide him in his quest for knowledge and mastery. Aman's rapid mastery of shadow magic
                allowed him to become a formidable opponent to the ruling class, but he still struggled to overcome the
                immense power they wielded. He knew that he needed to become even stronger if he was ever to
                succeed in his mission.

            <br>
            <p>
                In the meantime, Aman continued his attempts to be a thorn in his enemies’ sides. His latest plan
                involved a daring, bold plan that would surely undermine the ruling class and expose their corruption.
                He worked closely with a group of other childhood friends that he had grown up with, trusting them
                implicitly to keep his plan a secret. However, one of the people involved, Lenas, proved to be a
                traitor. He had been swayed by the promises of the ruling class, and he betrayed Aman and his allies,
                leading to the complete failure of their plan. Aman was captured and badly beaten, then promptly thrown
                into the streets. Aman had put his faith in Lenas, and his betrayal left him shaken and disillusioned.
                He began question the loyalties of everyone else that he worked with, as well as whether he would ever
                be able to bring about the change he so desperately sought.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Aman's quest for justice and equality had taken a toll on him, both physically and emotionally. He had
                been beaten down time and time again, and he began to feel that his efforts were entirely in vain. Aman
                had taken a dangerous risk that nearly cost him his life. He was left alone, battered, and broken. As he
                continued to ponder his current situation, he realized that his mission in Shadowfell was impossible to
                achieve. The ruling class was too powerful, and Aman realized that he would never be able to bring
                about the change he so desperately sought for the people of Shadowfell.

                <i>The Legend</i>
            </h6>
            <br>
            <p>
                Even as Aman grew into adulthood, his grandfather continued to tell him stories of old legends and
                fables. Among these was a tale of a powerful artifact that would grant unstoppable magical abilities and
                strength to its wielder. The artifact was used to overthrow an oppressive ruler, not so unlike that of
                the current regime. Aman dismissed this as just another one of his grandfather's fantastical stories
                that he so adored.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Years later, while reading an ancient tome he stumbled upon during his studies of shadow magic, Aman
                came across a passage describing the same artifact that his grandfather once told a legend about. He
                was stunned and in disbelief. Could it be true that such a powerful artifact exists? Aman became
                obsessed with the idea of finding this artifact, knowing that it could give him the power he needed to
                finally bring about the change he sought for Shadowfell. For years, Aman searched in secret for any
                information about the artifact's location, gathering every clue and lead he could find. His search was
                long and arduous, but he never gave up. Eventually, he felt that he was getting closer to his goal, but
                he was hesitant to trust anyone with this information.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                One day, Aman finally broke his silence and shared his discovery Bob, who had continued to be Aman's
                closest friend. Bob was somewhat surprised that Aman had discovered information about the artifact,
                but not entirely. He had heard legends of the same artifact from his own family. Between the legends
                that Aman's grandfather passed down and the ones passed down to Bob, they were able to piece
                together enough details for the legends to make sense in the context of what the tome was saying
                about it.

            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Aman explained to Bob the importance of the artifact in his persistent, but frustrating, dream to
                eliminate the socioeconomic inequality and corruption that pervaded Shadowfell. The artifact was the
                key to his success where he had repeatedly failed before. Aman's newfound hope and inspiration
                renewed his determination to find the artifact, no matter the cost.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Aman and Bob worked tirelessly together to continue the search for the artifact, despite facing
                numerous obstacles and setbacks. They knew that the journey would be dangerous and treacherous,
                but they were both determined to see it through to the end.
            </p>

                <i>Finding the Artifact</i>
            </h6>
            <br>
            <p>
                Aman and Bob journeyed for weeks through treacherous terrain, following the clues and rumors that
                they had pieced together about the artifact's location. They eventually arrived at what was supposed to
                be the mouth of a cave. What they found instead was a mountainside that was covered in rocks and
                boulders. After searching around, they determined that this looked like a rockslide had occurred a long,
                long time ago. Moving some of the rocks revealed what looked to be a cave entrance - right where they
                initially thought it should be located.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                After stepping into the cave, they noticed that it was incredibly well-preserved. As they ventured
                deeper into the cave, they discovered evidence of past habitation by someone who had once lived there
                long ago. Exploring further revealed structures that had been built into the cave - structures that very
                much resembled a dwelling.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Aman and Bob pressed on, driven by their determination to find the artifact. They eventually came upon
                a large chamber of the apparent dwelling, where the artifact openly sat on a table, looking exactly as
                the
                legends had said and the tome had depicted. Aman approached the table, feeling a sense of anticipation
                mixed with trepidation. Both of them knew what the legends said of the artifact. Anyone who touched
                it was to gain unstoppable magical abilities and strength. Aman looked back at Bob, who anxiously
                encouraged him to pick it up.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                As he reached for the artifact, he felt a surge of energy coursing through his body, and a portal opened
                before him. The portal shimmered with otherworldly light, and Aman felt a powerful force pulling him
                towards it. He hesitated for a moment, unsure of what lay beyond the portal, but his thirst for power
                and his desire for change ultimately drove him forward.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Aman stepped through the portal, but the moment that he did it closed behind him. He found himself in
                a strange and unfamiliar place. He was alone, with no sign of Bob anywhere. Most importantly, he did
                not feel any different than before. If he was provided with unstoppable magical abilities and strength,
                he certainly wasn't aware of it. He was disoriented and confused, but he knew that he had to press on.
                He had come too far and sacrificed too much to give up now. He needed to find the source of the
                legendary powers. He picked himself up and began to explore his surroundings, searching for any clues
                that might help him figure out where he was
            </p>
            <br>

            <h6>
                <i>Arrival in the Material Plane</i>
            </h6>
            <br>
            <p>
                Aman looked around, still clutching the artifact that had led him to this strange and unfamiliar world.
                The artifact seemed to do nothing anymore - no longer showing any signs of magic, and certainly not
                any signs of providing the unstoppable magic abilities and strength that he convinced it would provide.
                He felt a sense of profound disappointment and anger wash over him. He had sacrificed so much in his
                quest to obtain the artifact, only to be left empty-handed once again.

            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                As he took in his surroundings, Aman realized that he was in a new world entirely distinct from his own.
                The skies were a different color, the vegetation was unfamiliar, and the air smelled strange. The land
                he was in seemed almost mythical, but it was one that he certainly recognized from his studies - the
                Material Plane. He knew that Shadowfell existed in a realm that was separate from others. He knew
                that others had traveled between those realms before. He did not, however, think that he would ever
                get the opportunity to observe this land for himself.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Looking back at the artifact, Aman observed that it had strange writings etched into it, but Aman could
                not understand what they meant. He was fluent in Common - a necessity to effectively communicate
                with the many races that called the Shattered Isles home. He also knew Abyssal, as that was required
                for his studies of magical summoning. The writings etched into the artifact, though, looked nothing
                even relatively similar to either language he was familiar with. What if he had done something wrong?
                What if there was still more to do? He began to feel lost and disoriented, unsure of what to do next.

            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                After some exploration and thought, Aman determined that the legends he had been told were as
                incorrect as he initially believed when his grandfather told him those fantastical stories. He was now
                convinced that the artifact was a simple portal to this strange new world. He was both frustrated and
                curious at the same time. Frustrated that he had failed to gain the power he had hoped for, but curious
                about what this new world had to offer. Aman began to think through his current situation, determining
                that he should explore this plane of existence that he found himself in. After all, it still might hold
                something of value for him in his quest to overthrow the ruling class back home. He thought that there
                would certainly be something to learn from the beings in this plane that might assist him in his
                endeavors. Moreover, this excursion could prove to be one that provides him a welcome break from his
                struggles and repeated failures back home.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Aman decided that he must keep his true identity hidden until the time was right, though. He did not
                know what allies the powerful elites back home might have, and certainly did not know if they had any
                connection to the other planes. He felt a sense of relief knowing that he could explore this new world
                without fear of being easily discovered by his enemies, but did not want to compromise that by sharing
                his real name. While in this plane, he determined that he would go by the name Merrick Ravenfall. With
                “Merrick” meaning “fame” or “power”, it seemed like an appropriate reminder of his purpose here in
                this plane. As he explored further, he began to wonder if he would ever be able to improve the lives of
                the poor and oppressed in Shadowfell. The daunting task of toppling the ruling class seemed more
                impossible than ever before.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Nevertheless, Aman was determined to press on. He knew that he had a long journey ahead of him, but
                he also knew that he had to keep moving forward. He had come too far and sacrificed too much to give
                up now. As he continued his journey, Aman was certain that he would discover new skills and make new
                allies that would eventually lead him back to Shadowfell, where he would continue his quest for justice
                and equality.

                Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it.

                For the duration, you can read the thoughts of certain creatures. When you cast the spell and as your

                within 30 feet of you. If the creature you choose has an Intelligence of 3 or lower or doesn’t speak any

                You initially learn the surface thoughts of the creature—what is most on its mind in that moment. As an

                into the same creature’s mind. If you probe deeper, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it
                fails, you gain insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state, and something that looms large
                in its mind (such as something it worries over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds, the spell ends. Either
                way, the target knows that you are probing into its mind, and unless you shift your attention to another
                creature’s thoughts, the creature can use its action on its turn to make an Intelligence check contested
                by your Intelligence check; if it succeeds, the spell ends.

                You can also use this spell to detect the presence of thinking creatures you can’t see. When you cast
                the spell or as your action during the duration, you can search for thoughts within 30 feet of you. The
                spell can penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other than lead, or a thin sheet
                of lead blocks you. You can’t detect a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or lower or one that doesn’t
                speak any language.
