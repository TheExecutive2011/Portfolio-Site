        <p>
            I'm a developer and I'm currently working on this portfolio site.  Once it's finished you'll find content designed for you to get to know me.  I'm a technologist, woodworker, video gamer, board gamer, audiophile, and disc golfer.  Ideally, you'll get insights into each of those areas of my life while also experiencing a demonstration of my web development skillset.
