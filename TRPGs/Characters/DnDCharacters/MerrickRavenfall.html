                You create a sound or an image of an object within range that lasts for the duration. The illusion also

                else's voice, a lion's roar, a beating of drums, or any other sound you choose. The sound continues
                unabated throughout the duration, or you can make discrete sounds at different times before the spell
                ends.

                larger than a 5-foot cube. The image can't create sound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect.
                Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it.

                If a creature uses its action to examine the sound or image, the creature can determine that it is an

                discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint to the creature.

                    You instantaneously clean or soil an object no larger than 1 cubic foot.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You chill, warm, or flavor up to 1 cubic foot of nonliving material for 1 hour.

                    You make a color, a small mark, or a symbol appear on an object or a surface for 1 hour.

                    You create a nonmagical trinket or an illusory image that can fit in your hand and that lasts until

                For the duration, you can read the thoughts of certain creatures. When you cast the spell and as your

                within 30 feet of you. If the creature you choose has an Intelligence of 3 or lower or doesn’t speak any

                You initially learn the surface thoughts of the creature—what is most on its mind in that moment. As an
                action, you can either shift your attention to another creature’s thoughts or attempt to probe deeper
                into the same creature’s mind. If you probe deeper, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it
                fails, you gain insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state, and something that looms large
                in its mind (such as something it worries over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds, the spell ends. Either
                way, the target knows that you are probing into its mind, and unless you shift your attention to another
                creature’s thoughts, the creature can use its action on its turn to make an Intelligence check contested
                by your Intelligence check; if it succeeds, the spell ends.

                You can also use this spell to detect the presence of thinking creatures you can’t see. When you cast
                the spell or as your action during the duration, you can search for thoughts within 30 feet of you. The
                spell can penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other than lead, or a thin sheet
                of lead blocks you. You can’t detect a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or lower or one that doesn’t
                speak any language.

                you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking. Similarly, you can cause the illusion to make
