      Thanks for visiting my website!

    <p>
      In a fast-paced world where our attention is stretched thin at all times, I appreciate that you chose to share
      some of that with me. If you're wondering why this site exists (who on Earth has a personal website for
      themselves?), you've reached the right page.

      <i>As a developer,</i> I'd like to share my professional experience and demonstrate my technical abilities. For
      information on my professional background, see the <a class='link' href="resume.html">Resume</a> page. If you'd
      like to see a demonstration of my technical abilities, keep exploring this site! Each page was designed to
      demonstrate a different technology or technique. On the <a class='link' href="space.html">Astrophile</a> page, for
      instance, you will find a live view of the International Space Station's current location. That view was built to
      demonstrate third-party API usage via JavaScript on the frontend that utilizes Node.js on the backend to make the
      requests to the third-party server. One purpose of this site is to serve as a portfolio that demonstrates a
      comprehensive set of technical abilities that will make a meaningful impact on a high-achieving team. <a
        class='link' href="contact.html">Let me know</a> if you would like to collaborate to achieve something great!

      <i>As an individual,</i> I'd like to provide an insight into my personal life experience. The <a class='link'
        href="WhoAmI.html">Who Am I?</a> page provides a great starting point for exploring my hobbies and interests.
      Regardless of how well you know me or how you reached this site, there are likely things about me that you didn't
      know. I always enjoy making connections with people that have interests in common with me. Those connections can't
      be made without first sharing experiences. <a class='link' href="contact.html">Let me know</a> if any of my
      hobbies or interests overlap with yours or if you are curious about something that you'd like to know more about!

    <h3>
      Core Values
    </h3>
    <br>
    <div class="indent">
      <h5>Education is a lifelong pursuit.</h5>
      <p>
        Everyone—regardless of age—has something to learn. Education is a continuous process that involves learning,
        growth, and self-improvement. The world rapidly evolves around us, and it's up to us to adapt to it. Given this,
        I recognize that I do not and cannot have all knowledge at any given point in time. There is never a point where
        I've learned all that there is to know. I also recognize that knowledge makes me a better human being. It allows
        me to better understand the world around me, as well as other peoples' perspectives. The result is that with
        knowledge, I will be better prepared to make a positive, lasting impact on society.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h5>Value creation is key.</h5>
      <p>
        I believe that providing value should always be a focus in everything I do. Whether it's through my work,
        personal relationships, or volunteer activities, I strive to make a positive impact on the people and
        organizations around me. By focusing on providing value, I believe that I can make a meaningful contribution to
        the world and help others achieve their goals.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h5>Empathy and respect matter.</h5>
      <p>
        I believe that treating others with empathy and kindness is essential for creating positive relationships and
        building trust. By approaching others with respect and understanding, I am able to connect with people on a
        deeper level and foster a sense of mutual respect. I believe that this approach is not only beneficial for
        personal relationships but also for professional collaborations and partnerships.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h5>Embrace open-mindedness.</h5>
      <p>
        Always be open minded. Diversity of thought is crucial to both personal and professional growth. It is not
        always easy to let go of preconceived notions or ideas, but doing so yields positive results. No one person
        knows everything. Allowing other perspectives to challenge my own provides me with the opportunity to improve
        upon
        my own ideas. This is essential for staying adaptable and innovative in a rapidly changing world.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h5>Trust the team.</h5>
      <p>
        Trust is essential for effective teamwork and collaboration. It enables colleagues to confidently perform
        their roles and responsibilities. When trust is an element of a team's dynamic, team members can communicate
        openly, share their unique perspectives, and work together to find solutions to challenges. Trust also allows
        team members to take calculated risks and innovate, knowing that their colleagues have their back. By
        prioritizing trust in my relationships with team members, I can help create a culture of collaboration and
        respect,
        where everyone feels valued and supported.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h5>Self-care must be prioritized.</h5>
      <p>
        Self-care matters. It's not just my own self-care that matters, though. Everyone's does. It is essential for
        maintianing physical and mental well-being. By prioritizing self-care practices, we are able to recharge and
        maintain a positive outlook on life. We're both happier and most productive when we're at our best both
        physically and mentally.

    <h3>
      Personal Background
    </h3>
    <br>
    <p>
      Being from Roanoke, Virginia, I've developed an appreciation for the outdoors. The "Big Lick," as Roanoke is
      called, imparted to me an enjoyment of hiking, camping, <a class="link" href="discgolf.html">disc golf</a>, and
      much more. The small city sits in the middle of the Roanoke Valley, with the beautiful Appalaichain Mountains in
      view no matter which direction you look. Growing up, I was a huge fan of the Roanoke Express (a now defunct ECHL
      hockey team), Virginia Tech's football program, and the Washington Redskins (now the Commanders).
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      I currently live in the Charlotte metropolitan area - a city that, notably, has no mountains within view of most
      areas. The city, however, is experiencing a period of rapid growth. There is always something new and exciting
      coming to the area, and I look forward to seeing this city continue to evolve with time. While remaining a Virginia
      Tech football and Washington Commanders fan, I've rekindled my love for hockey via the Charlotte Checkers.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      While I enjoy Charlotte, I am also fond of traveling - particularly to mountainous areas. I've explored most of
      the east
      coast (and some of the midwest) of the United States, as well as backpacked across Europe. Next on my list is to
      make it out to the west coast of the United States. I'd love to see for myself how the Rocky Mountains compare to
      either the Appalaichain Mountains or the Alps!
