        <br>
        <p>
            Portal, developed and published by Valve Corporation, is a first-person puzzle-platformer game initially
            released in 2007 as part of The Orange Box for PC, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3. As a unique and innovative
            title, Portal gained widespread acclaim for its ingenious gameplay mechanics, dark humor, and unforgettable
            story. In this review, I will discuss various aspects of the game, including the story, gameplay, graphics,
            and sound.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h5><i>Story</i></h5>
        <p>
            Portal takes place in the mysterious Aperture Science Enrichment Center, where players assume the role of
            Chell, a test subject who must navigate a series of increasingly challenging test chambers. Guided by the
            sinister yet comical AI, GLaDOS, Chell must use her wits and a unique portal-creating device to complete the
            tests and uncover the facility's secrets. The game's narrative is minimalistic yet incredibly engaging, with
            a perfect balance of dark humor and intriguing storytelling.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h5><i>Gameplay</i></h5>
        <p>
            The core gameplay mechanic of Portal revolves around the use of the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device,
            which allows players to create two connected portals on specific surfaces. Using these portals, players must
            solve a variety of puzzles that involve traversing the environment, manipulating objects, and avoiding
            hazards.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Portal's puzzles are expertly designed and become increasingly complex as the game progresses, requiring
            players to think creatively and master the portal mechanics. The game also introduces additional elements,
            such as energy balls, weighted cubes, and turrets, which add depth and challenge to the puzzles.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Despite its relatively short length, Portal offers a satisfying and rewarding gameplay experience, with a
            difficulty curve that keeps players engaged without feeling overwhelming.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h5><i>Graphics</i></h5>
        <p>
            While Portal's graphics may not be as cutting-edge today, the game's visual style remains timeless and
            effective. The sterile, industrial environments of the Aperture Science facility are complemented by the
            game's minimalist aesthetic, which helps maintain a sense of immersion and focus on the puzzles. The portal
            mechanics themselves are visually impressive, with seamless transitions and convincing spatial manipulation
            that still impresses today.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h5><i>Sound</i></h5>
        <p>
            Portal's sound design plays a vital role in establishing the game's atmosphere and personality. The ambient
            sounds of the facility create a sense of isolation and tension, while the humorous and menacing voiceovers
            from GLaDOS, masterfully performed by Ellen McLain, contribute significantly to the game's unique tone.
            Additionally, the game's closing song, "Still Alive," composed by Jonathan Coulton and performed by Ellen
            McLain, has become an iconic piece of gaming music history.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h5><i>Conclusion</i></h5>
        <p>
            Portal is a groundbreaking puzzle-platformer that continues to captivate players with its innovative
            gameplay, engaging story, and timeless humor. The game's unique portal mechanics, challenging puzzles, and
            memorable characters make it a must-play for fans of the genre and newcomers alike. Portal remains an
            essential title in gaming history and serves as a testament to the power of creative game design. If you
            haven't experienced the mind-bending world of Portal, it's never too late to step into the shoes of Chell
            and challenge the devious GLaDOS.
