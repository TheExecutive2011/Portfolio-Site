        <p class="rev_header_small">Created by: <i>Forrest-Pruzan Creative, Kami Mandell, Andrew Wolf</i></p>

        <br>
        <p>
            I'm thrilled to share my thoughts on a game that brings the magic of J.K. Rowling's beloved world to the tabletop: Harry Potter Hogwarts Battle. Designed by Forrest-Pruzan Creative, Kami Mandell, and Andrew Wolf, and published by USAopoly, this cooperative deck-building game invites players to take on the roles of Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Neville, as they work together to defend Hogwarts from the forces of darkness.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h5><i>Components</i></h5>
        <p>
            Harry Potter Hogwarts Battle comes in a beautifully designed box, containing 252 cards, 4 player boards, 4 House Dice, 1 game board, 7 game boxes (each representing a year at Hogwarts), 7 sets of Dark Arts cards, 8 Villain Control tokens, 35 various tokens, and a rulebook. The components are of excellent quality, with sturdy cards that feature clear and evocative artwork from the world of Harry Potter. The player boards, game board, and tokens all showcase a strong attention to detail, immersing players in the magical universe.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h5><i>Gameplay</i></h5>
        <p>
            Harry Potter Hogwarts Battle is a cooperative deck-building game for 2-4 players, with each player starting with a basic deck of 10 cards unique to their chosen character. The game is played over seven levels, each representing a year at Hogwarts, and each level introduces new challenges, cards, and mechanics.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Players take turns drawing cards from their deck, playing Action and Spell cards, and using their resources (influence) to acquire new cards from the shared Hogwarts supply. As players progress through the levels, they will encounter iconic characters, spells, and magical items from the Harry Potter series, all of which can be used to build powerful card combinations and defeat the Dark Arts cards and Villains threatening Hogwarts.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The game encourages players to work together, strategically planning their card plays, and pooling their resources to overcome challenges. The game ends in victory if the players manage to defeat all the Villains, or in defeat if the Villains gain control of all the locations on the game board.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h5><i>Playing Time and Replayability</i></h5>
        <p>
            A game of Harry Potter Hogwarts Battle typically takes around 30-60 minutes per level, with a full campaign lasting multiple sessions. The game offers high replayability due to the unique combination of cards in each playthrough, the evolving challenges across the levels, and the opportunity to try different character strategies.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h5><i>Conclusion</i></h5>
        <p>
            Harry Potter Hogwarts Battle is a magical and engaging game that provides a satisfying blend of strategy, decision-making, and teamwork. Its cooperative mechanics, immersive theme, and high replayability make it a fantastic addition to any board game collection, particularly for fans of the Harry Potter series or those who enjoy deck-building games. Step into the world of Harry Potter and join forces with your friends to defend Hogwarts and triumph over the forces of darkness, in an adventure that will create lasting memories and leave you spellbound.
